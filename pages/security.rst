Access & Security
=================

This is where you manage what can ping and connect to your virtual machine. It will be necessary to set up security groups and a key pair to be able to access your virtual machine and keep it secure.

- From here you can delete or create rules.

- To create a new rule, click the 'add rule' button and a dialouge box will appear. To set up your virtual machine you will need two new rules (in addition to the default security group):

- For allowing requests from IP addreses, create a SSH rule (at the bottom of the dropdown menu), choose the remote CIDR and 0.0.0.0/0 for any ip addresses
