The html files are not included in this repository. To generate them, download Sphinx  and run $sphinx-quickstart.

Keep all the defaults, however say yes to the autodoc extention.

once you have set up the directory, replace any files it generated (apart from "_build") with this repository and run the command $make html. This will generate all needed html pages.
